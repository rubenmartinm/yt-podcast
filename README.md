# yt-podcast
Podcast generator

## Objective
The objective of this project is to create a podcast feed generator from YT channels. It automatically downloads videos from specified channels, converts them into audio files, and generates an RSS feed for podcast distribution.

## Getting Started

### 1. Cloning the Repository
To clone the repository and run the project locally, follow these steps:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rubenmartinm/yt-podcast.git
cd yt-podcast
```

### 2. Configure your ip and port for the Web Server
Copy the `.env-example` and add your values:
```sh
cp .env-example .env
```

Edit with your values:
```yaml
MY_WEBSERVER_IP: '<YOUR IP>'  # Most probably with ifconfig eth0
MY_WEBSERVER_PORT: '<YOUR DESIRED PORT>'
UID: '1000' # You can run id to get theese
GID: '1001'
```

### 3. Add some YT Channel
Copy the `yt_channels.example.yaml` and add your values:
```
cd config
cp yt_channels.example.yaml yt_channels.yaml
```

Edit with your values. This can be an example:
```yaml
podcasts:
  PantomimaFull:
    youtube_channel: https://www.youtube.com/@PantomimaFull/videos
    image_url: https://yt3.googleusercontent.com/j3FWuqRMzLhTGBxWnrlhxatpmaTXvFuNM6oYIoIE7iHNoQChlxhz7hi2Wweu3SxRJaUxG1eM=s176-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj
    total_videos: 1
```

Back to the main directory:
```
cd ..
```

## Running the Web Server

A web server image is provided to serve the generated RSS feeds and audio files. Run the following command to start the web server:

``` bash
docker-compose up nginx -d
[+] Running 2/2
 ✔ Network yt-podcast_default  Created                                                                                               0.0s
 ✔ Container nginx             Started                                                                                               0.1s
```
You can check if the container is running with:
```sh
docker-compose ps nginx
NAME         IMAGE                                    COMMAND                  SERVICE      CREATED        STATUS         PORTS
nginx        nginx:latest                             "/docker-entrypoint.…"   nginx        28 hours ago   Up 8 minutes   0.0.0.0:9999->80/tcp, :::9999->80/tcp
```

## Running the Video Downloader

The video downloader image needs to be executed periodically to download new videos. Use the following command to run the video downloader:

```sh
docker-compose up yt-podcast -d
[+] Running 1/1
 ✔ Container yt-podcast  Started                                                                                                     0.0s
```

You can check if the container is running with:
```sh
docker-compose ps yt-podcast
NAME         IMAGE                                    COMMAND            SERVICE      CREATED              STATUS              PORTS
yt-podcast   ghcr.io/rubenmartinm/yt-podcast:latest   "python main.py"   yt-podcast   About a minute ago   Up About a minute
```

Additionally, you can check the execution with:
```sh
docker-compose logs yt-podcast -f
...
```

## Prepare everything for scheduling the automatic video download execution
To schedule execution of the downloader you can use like this:
```sh
EDITOR=vi crontab -e
# YT-Podcast
# This will execute everyday at 06:00 and 18:00
# You can use https://crontab.guru to create a valid expression
0 06,18 * * * cd /<YOUR_GLOBAL_PATH>/yt-podcast && docker-compose up yt-podcast > /dev/null 2>&1
```

## Configuring the Podcast Client

To configure your podcast client to access the generated RSS feeds, follow these steps:

1. Open your podcast client.
2. Add a new podcast subscription.
3. Enter the URL of the RSS feed generated by the web server.
4. Most likely will be this one: `http://<MY_WEBSERVER_IP>:<MY_WEBSERVER_PORT>/<CHANNEL_NAME>_feed.xml`
5. Save the subscription.

> Note: If accessing the service from outside your home network, you may need to set up a tunnel using WireGuard or another VPN solution to avoid exposing the service directly to the internet.

### Check the Web Server log
Additionally, you can check the logs to see the if the Podcast Client is reaching your Web Server with:
```sh
docker-compose logs nginx -f
...
```

## Stop everything and purge
You just have to stop the containers and remove the `yt-downloader` directory:
```sh
docker-compose down
cd ..
rm -r yt-podcast
```

## Pending Improvements
- Implement a background daemon in the video downloader image to automate the scraping process and download new videos as they become available.
